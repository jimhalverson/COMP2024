    "Let me clarify that the outset: homework 5 and your final project are *distinct*. The entirety of your grade on homework 5 is determined by your results from problems $1$ and $2$, which have nothing to do with your final project grade. Instead, I'm just using this as a space to clarify how you will present your final project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have over $20$ people in the class, your final project will be submitted as a slide deck, rather than presented in class. The slide deck should be $5$ slides long, and should be submitted as a PDF. The slides should be organized as follows:\n",
    "- Slide 1: Title slide, with your name, project title, and project supervisor.\n",
    "- Slide 2: The Problem.\n",
    "- Slide 3: Computational Technique.\n",
    "- Slides 4-5: Clear presentation of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deviation from this format will be penalized -- for fairness, I need to set guidelines for how the material is presented. "

    "In this problem we'll study the topology of two datasets located at `data/tda_1.pkl` and `data/tda_2.pkl`. For each of the datasets below:\n",
    "1. Compute the persistent homology.\n",
    "2. Analyze the persistence diagrams to determine the true (long-lived) topological features. State the number of non-trivial $k$-cycles for different $k$.\n",
    "3. *Level up / extra credit:* In the second dataset, use the result to guess the higher-dimensional manifold that the data is sampled from. If stuck, look up the Betti numbers of simple manifolds of appropriate dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: in the second dataset you'll have to pass the flag `maxdim` flag to ripser, since it is higher dimensional data. The data dimension is $4$, so that's the biggest value that makes sense to pass; if $4$ doesn't finish, try $3$, which is crucial to the problem."

Part of being a good scientist is being able to move past those obtacles to extract meaning from the data.\n",
