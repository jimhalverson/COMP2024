We'll talk about some other optimization techniques that can help us avoid these problems: simulated annealing and genetic algorithms.\n",

In 2000, Bousso and Polchinski gave a new answer to this problem from string theory, that there is a discretuum of vacua with different values of the cosmological constant. This large discretuum (at least, to the extent that the toy model is accurate) ensures the existence of small cosmological constants in string theory, but it doesn't mean it's easy to *find* them. We'll use optimization techniques to find them.\n",
