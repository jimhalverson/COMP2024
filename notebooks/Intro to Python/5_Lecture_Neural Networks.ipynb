The activation function is applied element-wise to its input.  The number of layers in the network is the depth of the network, and the number of neurons in each layer is the width of the network. The number of neurons in the input layer is the dimensionality of the input, and the number of neurons in the output layer is the dimensionality of the output.\n",

When the neural network is initialized on your computer these are drawn randomly from a distribution, but the process of machine learning involves some optimization process on the parameters to achieve some goal -- winning at chess, generating fake images of galaxies, classifying phases of matter, etc etc.  Parameters that are not updated during learning are called hyperparameters. The depth and width of the network are hyperparameters in this example."
